Hey everyone <b>Anand Kumar</b> this side. Welcome to my first blog where I will be introducing myself. I'm a Junior from National
Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering.<br>
I am a geek. I love life, computers and everything in between!<br>
I have been coding since my school days and soon realized that man this thing is so cool!
I am an A.I. enthusiast and have made various projects related to Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
and Web Development. Also I have completed a Data Analytics Internship at Pikkal & Co, Singapore and a 
Deep Learning Internship at Mavoix Solutions Pvt Ltd, Bangalore.

Wanna know more about me and my work? Below are some links, do check out;)<br>

Also one huge shout out to the guys at <b>GatsbyJS</b> for providing such an amazing blogging template(keep it simple and clean, they say!).
The biggest advantage of this template is that every blog is written in <b>Markdown</b>. So its gives alot of flexibility and functionality 
to the user to edit their texts. Plus their templates codebase is easy to understand so anyone can just clone and get started!

Anyways I guess this should wrap up this blog. See you in the next one where will be starting my GSoC journey and discuss my project ;)<br>
Till then take care and ba-bye :)
